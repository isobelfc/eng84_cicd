# CICD with Jenkins

- SDLC (software development lifecycle)
  - plan/design
  - develop
  - test
  - deploy
- problems in traditional SDLC
  - scale and complexity
    - functions
    - architecture
    - infrastructure
    - developers
    - operations
  - manual and slow process
  - broken communication
  - human errors
  - large volume of testing
  - long deployment window
  - high cost
  - customer dissatisfaction
- modern SDLC
  - collaboration
  - automation
  - iterative
- DevOps lifecycle stages
  - continuous development
  - continuous testing
  - continuous integration
  - continuous delivery/deployment
  - continuous monitoring
- CI - continuous integration
  - practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day
- CD
  - continuous delivery teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring it can be reliably released at any time, and deployment to production is manual
  - continuous deployment is the same, but deployment is automated

- CI/CD Pipeline
  - commit
  - build
  - automate tests
  - deploy

- why CI/CD
  - reduce cost
  - faster release rate
  - smaller code changes
  - fault isolations
  - more test reliability
  - increase team transparency and accountability
  - easy maintenance and updates
